;; The following rules implement a next-to relation that finds adjacent elements of a list:

; (rule (?x next-to ?y in (?x ?y . ?u)))
; 
; (rule (?x next-to ?y in (?v . ?z))
;       (?x next-to ?y in ?z))

;; What will the response be to the following queries?

(?x next-to ?y in (1 (2 3) 4))

; => (next-to (2 3) 4 in (1 (2 3) 4))
;    (next-to 1 (2 3) in (1 (2 3) 4))

(?x next-to 1 in (2 1 3 1))

; => (next-to 3 1 in (2 1 3 1))
;    (next-to 2 1 in (2 1 3 1))
;    (next-to 1 3 in (2 1 3 1))
